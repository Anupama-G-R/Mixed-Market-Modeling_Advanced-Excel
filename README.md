# Mixed-Market-Modeling_Advanced-Excel

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of Mixed Market Modeling (MMM) using Advanced Excel. 
It explores the relationship between marketing spend and sales, identifies key drivers, applies transformations to model media effects, and optimizes spend allocation to maximize sales efficiency.

## Key Features
### 1. Data Exploration
- Conducted thorough exploration of the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and patterns.

### 2. Feature Importance Analysis
- Built simple linear regression models to evaluate and rank the importance of different marketing channels.

### 3. Adstock Power and Lag Transformations
- Applied manual and automated Adstock transformations to capture media carryover and lagged effects on sales.

### 4. Spend Optimization
- Used Excel Solver to simulate and optimize media spend allocation for maximizing sales efficiency and ROI.
